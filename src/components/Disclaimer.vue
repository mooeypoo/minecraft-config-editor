        This interface website was design to simplify the editing of some Minecraft plugin configuration files.
        <strong>The developer(s) and owners cannot and do not take any responsibility at all for the resulting config file, or its behavior</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is up to the server admins to verify the behavior and operation of any and all config files before uploading them to a production/functional server.
      </p>
      <p>That said, we'd love to hear from you!</p>
